### Anthropic Agent Eval Framework
*Source: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents*

Authoritative guide on building reliable agent evaluations with multi-layer grading and early development focus.

**Key finding:** Start with 20-50 real failure cases rather than waiting for hundreds - early development shows large effect sizes that small samples can detect.

### Trace-Driven AI Development
*Source: https://blog.langchain.com/in-software-the-code-documents-the-app-in-ai-the-traces-do/*

LangChain argues traces replace code as documentation in AI apps since decision logic happens at runtime in models.

**Key finding:** AI agent code is just scaffolding - actual decision-making happens in the model at runtime, making traces the new source of truth.

### Agent Design Pattern Analysis
*Source: https://x.com/RLanceMartin/status/2009683038272401719*

Lance Martin synthesizes production agent patterns from $2B Manus and $1B Claude Code success stories.

**Key finding:** Context management is the fundamental challenge separating production agents from demos, with progressive disclosure reducing token usage by 70-90%.

## Connections

- All three items emphasize moving from theoretical to production-grade agent development with concrete metrics and frameworks
- Anthropic's eval framework and Martin's context management both identify starting small (20-50 cases vs few tools) as key to scaling successfully
- LangChain's trace-driven development and Martin's context engineering both highlight runtime behavior as more important than static code architecture

## Open Threads

- The convergence on observability tooling (traces, evals, context management) suggests a mature agent development stack is emerging - worth tracking standardization efforts
- Context management appears as the bottleneck across all three sources - investigate if this is being addressed by foundation model improvements or remains an application-layer problem
- Production agent economics (cache hit rates, token optimization, eval costs) seem critical but underexplored - monitor how cost optimization affects agent capability
