ColPali \u200b \n \n \n 1) Reflection pattern \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The AI reviews its work to spot mistakes and iterate until it produces the final response. \n 2) Tool use pattern \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tools allow LLMs to gather more information by: \n Querying a vector database \n \n Executing Python scripts \n \n Invoking APIs, etc. \n \n This is helpful since the LLM is not solely reliant on its internal knowledge. \n 3) ReAct (Reason and Act) pattern \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ReAct combines the above two patterns: \n The Agent can reflect on the generated outputs. \n \n It can interact with the world using tools. \n \n This makes it one of the most powerful patterns used today. \n 4) Planning pattern \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Instead of solving a request in one go, the AI creates a roadmap by: \n Subdividing tasks \n \n Outlining objectives \n \n This strategic thinking can solve tasks more effectively. \n 5) Multi-agent pattern \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In this setup: \n We have several agents. \n \n Each Agent is assigned a dedicated role and task. \n \n Each Agent can also access tools. \n \n All agents work together to deliver the final outcome while delegating tasks to other agents if needed. \n \n We'll soon dive deep into each of these patterns, showcasing real-world use cases and code implementations. \n In the meantime, make sure you are fully equipped with everything we have covered so far like: \n \u200b RAG fundamentals \u200b \n \n \u200b RAG evaluation \u200b \n \n \u200b RAG optimization \u200b \n \n \u200b Multimodal RAG \u200b \n \n \u200b Graph RAG \u200b \n \n \u200b Multivector retrieval using ColBERT \u200b \n \n \u200b RAG over complex real word docs ft.
